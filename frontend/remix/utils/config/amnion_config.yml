            Amnion is an open-source software framework and content management system that builds a
            native-like user experience in the browser. It uses the power of distributed networks and
            "smart contracts" that ultimately take application data and use it as a tradeable asset.

            While Amnion is written mostly in javascript, it isn't strictly a frontend or backend framework. A blend of the two is required 
            to deploy an interface. However, we aim to provide both frontend and backend devs with a powerful and accessible solution for building these 
            native-like experiences. 
            Amnion uses it's own JSX runtime to render Gnome desktop UI widgets. The "desktop" is then streamed into the HTML canvas. Additionally, the server handles 
            all programatic tasks while the browser persists the data. This allows the interface to fetch and mutate user data across data protocols
            and store none of it server side. Once re-deployed the browser feeds Amnion the hashed state of the application and it's datastore. Picking up where it left off.
