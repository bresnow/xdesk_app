    # 

 We are not a trading platform... We are an asset issuer. Assets as we issue them digitally represent assigned value. 
 Your next idea/painting/deed of agreement/<insert noun /> is an asset. .
 Once the asset belongs to you, a curated and selective list of services are permanently assigned. All data that builds
 your asset is stored on a public ledger that monitors all of it's transactions. 
 The data that is produced statefully is [ encrypted & compressed && ] stored in your browser's indexedDatabase. 

 Before it even hit's your wallet. We want to help build a system that separates value from price. Tokenizing your 
 asset does not make it special by default.
